 # Don't Care Where is like Tinder, for dinner.

It's an app for those of you that have been in the situation with friends, or a significant other, and you can't decide what to do for dinner. 

Don't sacrifice your bran cells trying to figure out where they want to go. Pull up **Don't Care Where** on your phone and start swiping.
