Don't Care Where is like Tinder, for dinner.

It's an app for those of you that have been in the situation with friends, or a significant other, and you can't decide what to do for dinner. 

Don't sacrifice your bran cells trying to figure out where they want to go. Pull up Don't Care Where on your phone and start swiping.
